## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Explained the acronym NP-MOJO in the description text.

* Removed the \donttest{} wrapping from all examples and updated the examples to execute in <5s.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
